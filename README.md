# ytdl-downloader
A small terminal based program that downloads youtube videos in mp4 or mp3. It uses Yt-dl.

For more information about any errors you may encounter when attemting to download, I encourage you go look up yt-dl documentation at: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme.

## Requirements
You absolutelty need to have youtube-dl and ffmpeg tools installed. Otherwise, the program won't simply work.
