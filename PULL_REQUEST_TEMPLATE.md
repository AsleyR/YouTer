## Requirements for your pull request

What I want is the pull request title to properly convey _what exactly did you do?_ And the pull request comment to explain _what you do? and/or _why?_

- This pull request has a title that starts with the keywords, `Add`, `Fix`, `Typo`, `Update`, or `Delete` first followed by the **_Name of the File_** that the keyword is refering to.

  - ✅ `Add options_w.py`
  - ✅ `Fix main_w.py`
  - ✅ `Update README.md`
  - ✅ `Delete unused_file.py`
  - ✅ `Typo README.md`
  - ❌ `add Options`
  - ❌ `readme`
  - ❌ `FIX MAIN`
  - ❌ `UpDate readme`
  - ❌ `Delete file`
  - ❌ `Typo`

- The default branch should be named [`main` not `master`](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/).
